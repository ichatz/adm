## Introduction to Python Basic & Compound data types and Pandas using Rome's Municipality Open Data Portal

The lab provides a quick introduction to basic operations on Python data types and on Pandas Series and Dataframes. The lab concludes with some hands-on data engineering based on a dataset (in CSV format) provided by the [Open Data portal of the City of Rome](http://dati.comune.roma.it/). In particular, the lab uses the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2019](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d823/resource/9964559d-0a9b-4dd6-a417-eb1ed019ab59). 

The lab material is available as an iPython notebook:

## Data Visualization based on MatplotLib and Pandas using Rome's Municipality Open Data Portal

The lab provides a quick introduction to basic operations of the [MatplotLib, a Python 2D plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/). The lab uses the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2019](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d823/resource/9964559d-0a9b-4dd6-a417-eb1ed019ab59) in order to visualize certain aspects.
