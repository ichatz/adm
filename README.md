The repository contains support material for the lab classes of the *Algorithmic Methods for Data Science* course taught as part of the [Data Science master](http://datascience.i3s.uniroma1.it/it) at [Sapienza University](http://www.uniroma1.it/). The class was tought during the following years: 
* [2019-2020](http://aris.me/index.php?id=42)

The material for earlier years is available under the [2015-2017](/ichatz/adm/tree/2015-2017) branch, tought during:
* [2018-2019](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2018)
* [2017-2018](http://aris.me/index.php/data-mining-ds-2017)

## Introduction to Python Basic & Compound data types and Pandas using Rome's Municipality Open Data Portal

The lab provides a quick introduction to basic operations on Python data types and on Pandas Series and Dataframes. The lab concludes with some hands-on data engineering based on a dataset (in CSV format) provided by the [Open Data portal of the City of Rome](http://dati.comune.roma.it/). In particular, the lab uses the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2019](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d823/resource/9964559d-0a9b-4dd6-a417-eb1ed019ab59). 

The lab material is available as an iPython notebook:

## Data Visualization based on MatplotLib and Pandas using Rome's Municipality Open Data Portal

The lab provides a quick introduction to basic operations of the [MatplotLib, a Python 2D plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/). The lab uses the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2019](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d823/resource/9964559d-0a9b-4dd6-a417-eb1ed019ab59) in order to visualize certain aspects.

## Data Engineering with Pandas and Document Databases using Rome's Municipality Open Data Portal

The lab carries out a series of data engineering tasks on the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2019](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d823/resource/9964559d-0a9b-4dd6-a417-eb1ed019ab59) in combination with the [dataset listing all hotels, hostels and in general all the structures that can receive guests within Rome, that are active during January 2018](https://dati.comune.roma.it/catalog/dataset/d198/resource/69b5af35-2088-42a2-bbf9-be8c60408eaf) to compare the growth between the 2 years.

In the sequel, a document database, such as [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com), to store & organize the data.
